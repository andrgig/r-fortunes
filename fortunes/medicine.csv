"1. DO NOT EXPECT YOUR DOCTOR TO SHARE YOUR DISCOMFORT.

"A woman went into a hospital one day to give birth.  Afterwards, the doctor
came to her and said, \"I have some... odd news for you.\"
	\"Is my baby all right?\" the woman anxiously asked.
	\"Yes, he is,\" the doctor replied, \"but we don't know how.  Your son
(we assume) was born with no body.  He only has a head.\"
	Well, the doctor was correct.  The Head was alive and well, though no
one knew how.  The Head turned out to be fairly normal, ignoring his lack of
a body, and lived for some time as typical a life as could be expected under
the circumstances.
	One day, about twenty years after the fateful birth, the woman got a
phone call from another doctor.  The doctor said, \"I have recently perfected
an operation.  Your son can live a normal life now: we can graft a body onto
his head!\"

up.  She ran up the stairs saying, \"Johnny, Johnny, I have a *wonderful*

"After his legs had been broken in an accident, Mr. Miller sued for damages,
claming that he was crippled and would have to spend the rest of his life
